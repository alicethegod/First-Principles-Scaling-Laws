# First-Principles-Scaling-Laws
This repository contains the official code for the paper "A First-Principles Derivation of Neural Scaling Laws". We demonstrate how macroscopic scaling laws (D-Scaling, N-Scaling, Chinchilla's Law) emerge from a single microscopic Hebbian dynamical equation, driven by the antagonistic dynamics between generalization and memorization.
